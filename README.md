Inspired by the classic Chrome offline game by Google, with Among Us references, coded in the processing language.

# How does it work?

Jump over the obstacles.<br>
Every 10 rounds the speed will increase until the maximum speed of 5 is reached.<br>
It'll then stay steady.<br>
Every time you collide with an obstacle, you'll get a fail point.<br>
After 10 fails the game will end.<br>

# Controls

"space" to jump.<br>

"p" turns on NSFW mode. Dont judge me.<br>
"o" turns off NSFW mode.<br>

"i" turns on a bot which does the job for you.<br>
"u" turns that bot off.<br>

"z" turns on developer mode. This draws lines between the character and the obstacle to help you understand how the obstacle detection works.<br>
"t" turns off developer mode.<br>
