# dino_game_amogus
Inspired by the classic offline dinosaur game by Google with Among Us references, coded in the processing language.<br>

How does it work?<br>

Jump over the obstacles.<br>
Every 10 rounds the speed will increase until the maximum speed of 5 is reached.<br>
It'll then stay steady.<br>
Every time you collide with an obstacle, you'll get a fail point.<br>
After 10 fails the game will end.<br>

-----

Controls:<br>

"space" to jump.<br>

"p" turns on NSFW mode. Dont judge me.<br>
"o" turns off NSFW mode.<br>

"i" turns on a bot which does the job for you.<br>
"u" turns that bot off.<br>

"z" turns on developer mode. This draws lines between the character and the obstacle to help you understand how the obstacle detection works.<br>
"t" turns off developer mode.<br>

Important: When the bot is turned on you and you want to use another mode simultaneously, you must press "space" a few times to make sure the bot works properly.
